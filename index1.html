            <h1>Adya Mohanty's Biography</h1>
            <p><strong>Hi!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            My name is Adya, and I am a rising senior from northern New Jersey. I first heard about SU Pre-College Programs from my guidance counselor, who recommended It Girls to me, and I'm so grateful she did. I am considering majoring in computer science, and am especially interested in pursuing some sort of interdisciplinary study in college. I have been unable to take many computer science classes in school, however, so I was intrigued by how broad the content we will cover is, and I am excited to get a taste of a little bit of everything surrounding technology and women in technology. 
         </p>

                <h2>Personal Info</h2>
            Otherwise, I love musical theater, singing, and dancing. My favorite TV show is <strong>Avatar: The Last Airbender</strong>, and I am a huge fan of Taylor Swift. I also adore cats and dogs, but unfortunately do not have any pets. Hopefully, that will change when I become older. 
            </p>
            <p>            
            I look forward to expanding my horizons in this course and getting to know/work with all of you in the coming weeks!
