       <h2>My Favorite HTML Tutorial</h2>

           The following video is one I found which goes over how to make a simple homepage for a website using HTML. Whereas we have been working on the functional aspect of web development, this video goes over how to customize the aesthetics of the page, while also going over some things we learned, such as how to create navigation links. This is a short video with instructions that are simple enough for even a beginner to follow. I hope you find this video to be useful!

       <h2>The Importance of Cryptography</h2>
       <p>Adya Mohanty / July 20th, 2021</p>
       <p> 
           Cryptography is an important part of computer science that allows data transactions to occur securely on the internet. Overall, cryptography is a positive study because it is used to secure so many processes such as taking money out of an ATM, sending a text message, and file storage. It was really interesting to learn about the history behind cryptography and how complicated messages were encrypted and decrypted by hand, and how now that tedious work has been streamlined thanks to modern technology.

           This past Friday, we learned about the history of women in gaming, both in design and playing, and learned about the significance of games beyond entertainment. Rather, Dr. Racquel Gonzalez from the Strong Museum of Play told us, video games can be used to educate and tell a story. She gave us an example of a video game that was developed by an indigenous American woman, in order to raise awareness of the struggles that Native American people have gone through. 

Then, we were tasked to come up with our own video game. Our team was asked to make a video game to help teachers become better at addressing students with appropriate pronouns and acknowledging gender identity. Furthermore, we were challenged to make the game inspired by Among Us. Getting the ball rolling took some time, since it was dificult to figure out how to make Among Us educational. However, we soon came up with some ideas. Instead of the nameless, genderless blobs of traditional Among Us, our game would have human avatars, with randomized names, appearances, and pronouns in order to get teachers accustomed to pronouns, names and appearances that may not fit traditional gender norms. Furthermore, the tasks would be memory-based, in order to help teachers memorize pronouns and other information about their students. And finally, since we are catering to educators, the map and final objective would be school-related. For example, rooms might include a computer lab, cafeteria, and gym, and the game's objective might be to identify who is causing mischief around the classroom, such as stealing all the pencils. Not only was this lesson very enjoyable, but it was informative, and got us to collaborate and use our creative thinking.
