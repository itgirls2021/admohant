       <h2>My Favorite HTML Tutorial</h2>
       <p>Adya Mohanty / July 28th, 2021</p>
       <p> 
           The following video is one I found which goes over how to make a simple homepage for a website using HTML. Whereas we have been working on the functional aspect of web development, this video goes over how to customize the aesthetics of the page, while also going over some things we learned, such as how to create navigation links. This is a short video with instructions that are simple enough for even a beginner to follow. I hope you find this video to be useful!

       <h2>The Importance of Cryptography</h2>
       <p>Adya Mohanty / July 20th, 2021</p>
       <p> 
           Cryptography is an important part of computer science that allows data transactions to occur securely on the internet. Overall, cryptography is a positive study because it is used to secure so many processes such as taking money out of an ATM, sending a text message, and file storage. It was really interesting to learn about the history behind cryptography and how complicated messages were encrypted and decrypted by hand, and how now that tedious work has been streamlined thanks to modern technology.
