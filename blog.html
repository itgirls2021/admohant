           The following video is one I found which goes over how to make a simple homepage for a website using HTML. Whereas we have been working on the functional aspect of web development, this video goes over how to customize the aesthetics of the page, while also going over some things we learned, such as how to create navigation links. This is a short video with instructions that are simple enough for even a beginner to follow. I hope you find this video to be useful!
